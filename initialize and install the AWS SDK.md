initialize and install the AWS SDK for Go v2 (including EC2 service and types), follow these steps:
✅ 1. Create Your Go Project

Open your terminal and run:

mkdir my-aws-project
cd my-aws-project
go mod init my-aws-project

✅ 2. Install AWS SDK for Go v2 packages

Run the following to install the necessary modules:

go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws
go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config
go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ec2

The types package comes bundled with the EC2 SDK, so you do not need to install ec2/types separately.

    ❗️ There is no package called github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ec2/types/ec2types — that path is incorrect. Use just types from the EC2 import.
