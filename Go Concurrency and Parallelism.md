Concurrency vs Parallelism on Multi-core Machines

    Concurrency: This is the ability to handle multiple tasks at once by switching between them. This doesn't mean all tasks are executed simultaneously. On a single-core CPU, for example, the tasks are interleaved, with the CPU switching between tasks. Even though they aren't running at the same time, they give the illusion of running concurrently.

    Parallelism: This means running multiple tasks at the exact same time. This is possible when the system has multiple CPU cores. On a multi-core system, Go can assign different goroutines to different cores, and they will run truly in parallel.

2. How Go Leverages Parallelism

    When you have a multi-core machine, Go's runtime can take advantage of the multiple cores by spreading the goroutines across the available CPU cores.

    Go scheduler will distribute goroutines across available CPU cores, so if you have 4 CPU cores and 10 goroutines, the scheduler may run some of the goroutines on different cores, in parallel.

3. How Does Go Determine Parallelism?

    Go's runtime automatically decides how many goroutines should be run in parallel based on the number of available CPU cores. By default, Go runs goroutines concurrently, but if you have multiple cores, it will use parallelism to spread the work across them.

    You can control how many OS threads Go can use for parallelism with the GOMAXPROCS variable.

        By default, GOMAXPROCS is set to the number of available CPU cores.

        If you set GOMAXPROCS to 1, Go will run everything on a single core and will only run goroutines concurrently, not in parallel.

        If you leave GOMAXPROCS to its default value, Go will allow the runtime to decide the best number of threads to use for parallel execution based on your system's CPU cores.

Example:

import (
    "fmt"
    "runtime"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // By default, Go will use the number of available CPU cores
    fmt.Println("CPU Cores: ", runtime.NumCPU()) // Shows the number of CPU cores available
    
    // You can change how many CPU cores Go should use for parallelism
    runtime.GOMAXPROCS(4) // For example, use 4 CPU cores

    // Start goroutines
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Goroutine 1 starting")
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        fmt.Println("Goroutine 1 done")
    }()
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Goroutine 2 starting")
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        fmt.Println("Goroutine 2 done")
    }()
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Goroutine 3 starting")
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        fmt.Println("Goroutine 3 done")
    }()
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Goroutine 4 starting")
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        fmt.Println("Goroutine 4 done")
    }()
    
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // Allow goroutines to finish
}

4. What Happens if GOMAXPROCS is Set?

    If you don't explicitly set GOMAXPROCS, Go will automatically set it to the number of available CPU cores on your system.

    If you set it to a number lower than the available cores, Go will limit the number of concurrent threads (and therefore the number of parallel goroutines) it can use.

    If you set it to a higher number, Go will use that many threads to handle goroutines, though the physical CPU cores may limit how many can run in true parallelism.

Example of Parallelism in Action:

If you have a multi-core machine and you launch multiple goroutines with a high enough level of parallelism, Go will attempt to run those goroutines on different cores.

For example, on a quad-core machine (4 CPU cores):

    If you launch 4 goroutines and leave GOMAXPROCS set to the default (which is 4), Go will run those 4 goroutines in parallel on the 4 cores. They can truly run at the same time.

    If you launch 10 goroutines on the same machine, Go will schedule the goroutines to run concurrently, and some goroutines might run on the same core at different times (depending on how many available threads there are).

5. Important Consideration:

    Parallelism works only on multi-core machines. If your system has a single core, Go can only run one goroutine at a time, though it still uses concurrency to switch between them.

    Concurrency allows Go to handle many tasks without necessarily running them in parallel. With multiple goroutines, Go can manage many tasks at once, but only a limited number (depending on cores) can run simultaneously.

Summary:

    Concurrency refers to the ability of your program to handle multiple tasks at once (even if they aren’t actually running at the same time).

    Parallelism refers to actually running multiple tasks at the same time, which happens when you have multiple CPU cores available, and Go assigns goroutines to those cores.

So, on a multi-core system, Go can utilize parallelism to run multiple goroutines simultaneously across multiple cores, while still keeping the program's tasks concurrent.


 Go's concurrency model is designed to handle different types of hardware configurations, including single-core machines. Here's how it works:
1. Single-Core Machines (No Parallelism):

    On a single-core machine, Go won't fail. It will still execute multiple goroutines, but they will be run sequentially, not in parallel.

    Since Go uses a goroutine scheduler that manages concurrency, it will switch between goroutines very quickly, giving the illusion of parallelism. Even though only one goroutine can be executing at a time (because there's only one CPU core), Go will handle switching between them efficiently.

    Concurrency will still be in effect, which means the program can handle multiple tasks at once, but the tasks will be executed one after the other.

2. Multi-Core Machines (Parallelism Enabled):

    On a multi-core machine, Go can run multiple goroutines in parallel across the available CPU cores.

    If you have a 4-core machine, Go can run 4 goroutines at the same time on the 4 cores, which improves performance because tasks are truly being executed simultaneously.

3. What Happens Internally:

    Single-Core: On a single-core machine, Go runs the goroutines one at a time. The scheduler switches between them, but only one is active at a time. The operating system’s kernel is responsible for scheduling tasks and ensuring they run.

    Multi-Core: On a multi-core machine, Go uses the Go runtime scheduler to distribute goroutines across available cores, ensuring they are run in parallel as much as possible.

4. No Special Configuration Needed:

    The beauty of Go is that it automatically handles concurrency and parallelism based on the number of available CPU cores. You don't need to manually configure it for single-core or multi-core systems.

    Even if your machine only has 1 CPU core, Go will still be able to run the program and execute multiple goroutines concurrently, though they won't run in parallel.

5. Performance Consideration:

    On a single-core machine, the performance won't be as fast as it would be on a multi-core machine because the tasks have to be executed sequentially, but the program won't crash or fail due to having multiple goroutines. The system will still run the tasks one after another in an efficient manner.

    On a multi-core machine, the performance can be significantly improved because Go can leverage parallelism and execute tasks across multiple cores simultaneously.

Example:

Let’s say you have a program that performs tasks (like downloading files, processing data, etc.) using goroutines. Here’s what will happen:

    On a Single-Core Machine: Go will execute these tasks sequentially, but it will do so in a non-blocking way. For example, if one task is waiting on I/O, Go can start running another goroutine in the meantime.

    On a Multi-Core Machine: Go will run as many goroutines as possible in parallel, distributing them across the available CPU cores. If you have 4 CPU cores and 8 goroutines, Go will run 4 of them simultaneously, then switch to the next batch.

Conclusion:

    Go will work on a single-core machine without issue, running tasks sequentially and switching between them as needed (via concurrency).

    On multi-core machines, Go will leverage parallelism to execute goroutines in true parallel, improving performance.

So yes, Go is designed to work on both single-core and multi-core machines, and it will not fail on a single-core machine. It just won't take advantage of parallelism.

goroutines are concurrent, and they can be parallel depending on the number of CPU cores available and how the Go runtime schedules them. Let's break down the concepts of concurrency and parallelism:
Concurrency:

    Concurrency is when multiple tasks are in progress at the same time, but not necessarily running at the exact same moment.

    In a concurrent system, multiple tasks (or goroutines in Go) make progress independently, but the operating system or runtime might switch between tasks to give the illusion that they are running simultaneously, even though they might not all be running at the same time.

    Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks at once, but not necessarily executing them in parallel.

Parallelism:

    Parallelism is when multiple tasks are literally running at the same time, typically on separate CPU cores or processors.

    In a parallel system, multiple tasks run simultaneously, executing on different cores of the CPU. This requires hardware with multiple CPU cores.

Goroutines: Concurrency by Default

    Goroutines are concurrent by default.

        A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution managed by the Go runtime. When you launch a goroutine using the go keyword, it runs concurrently with the other goroutines.

        The Go runtime uses a work-stealing scheduler to assign goroutines to available CPU cores.

        If you have a single core, goroutines will still be scheduled concurrently, but they won’t run in parallel.

        If you have multiple cores, the Go runtime can schedule goroutines to run in parallel on different CPU cores, but the programmer doesn't need to manually manage this.

When Do Goroutines Run in Parallel?

    Parallel execution of goroutines happens when:

        Your program is running on a machine with multiple CPU cores.

        The Go runtime's scheduler is able to assign goroutines to different cores. This can happen automatically if Go detects that your machine has more than one core.

You can control how many CPU cores Go will use by setting the GOMAXPROCS environment variable or using the runtime.GOMAXPROCS(n) function in your code.

For example, to tell Go to use all available CPU cores:

runtime.GOMAXPROCS(runtime.NumCPU())

Difference Between Concurrency and Parallelism:
Concept	Concurrency	Parallelism
Definition	Dealing with many things at once (but not necessarily at the same time).	Performing many things at the same time.
Execution	Can be done on a single CPU core (tasks appear to run concurrently).	Requires multiple CPU cores (tasks run simultaneously on different cores).
Purpose	Make progress on multiple tasks (e.g., responding to requests, handling IO).	Speed up tasks by splitting them across multiple processors.
Goroutines	Can run concurrently on one core, with the scheduler switching between them.	Can run in parallel across multiple cores.
Example:

Let’s say you have 4 goroutines and a 2-core machine.

    Concurrency: All 4 goroutines might be executed concurrently by the Go scheduler, but they will be interleaved on the two available CPU cores. The scheduler will switch between them so they appear to be running at the same time, but only two goroutines are running at any given instant on the two CPU cores.

    Parallelism: If your machine has 4 CPU cores, the Go scheduler can run 4 goroutines simultaneously, with each goroutine running on a different core.

Summary:

    Concurrency in Go means that multiple goroutines can run at the same time, but not necessarily in parallel. The Go runtime schedules them to give the illusion of simultaneity.

    Parallelism happens when goroutines run on different CPU cores at the exact same time.

    Goroutines are concurrent by default, and they can run in parallel if the Go runtime is running on a machine with multiple CPU cores.
