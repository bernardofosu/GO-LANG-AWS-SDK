 1. Go: Preemptive Concurrency

Go’s runtime manages context switching between goroutines:

    Even on one core, Go can "pause" a goroutine and resume another.

    If one goroutine is waiting (e.g., time.Sleep, network), others continue immediately.

    You don’t need to await, the runtime handles it.

go doThing1()
go doThing2()
// both appear to run "in parallel", even on 1 core

🔸 2. Node.js / Python: Cooperative Event Loop

You must manually yield back to the event loop using await (Python: await, Node.js: await or callbacks):

    If a task doesn’t yield, it blocks the event loop.

    Easy to accidentally write blocking code.

async function run() {
  await doThing1(); // must await properly
  await doThing2();
}

If you forget await, or use while (true) {} — it blocks everything.
🧪 Summary: Which is Better?
Case	Winner	Why
Lots of async I/O	Tie	Both handle I/O well
Accidental blocking risk	✅ Go	Blocking one goroutine doesn’t hurt others
Ease of use	✅ Go	Feels like normal code
CPU-heavy tasks (on 1 core)	⚠️ Both limited	But Go can be more robust
✅ Final Verdict (Single Core)

    Go is more robust under mixed workloads: blocking or sleeping one goroutine won’t stall others.

    Node.js/Python asyncio require discipline — forgetting one await can break everything.

    Both can simulate concurrency, but Go’s preemptive runtime gives it a major edge in safety and simplicity.
