Why Use an Alias?
Because many AWS SDK modules (like types, config, input, output) are all named generically, using an alias avoids ambiguity:

go
Copy
Edit
import (
    ec2types "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ec2/types"
    s3types  "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3/types"
)
Now you can clearly distinguish:

go
Copy
Edit
ec2types.InstanceTypeT2Micro
s3types.BucketLocationConstraintUsWest2
