When you do:

wg.Add(2) // Expecting 2 goroutines to complete

Then each goroutine must call:

defer wg.Done() // Decreases the internal counter by 1

After both wg.Done() calls, the internal counter becomes 0, and then:

wg.Wait() // Unblocks because the counter reached zero

So you can think of it like this:
Step	Internal Counter
wg.Add(2)	2
first wg.Done()	1
second wg.Done()	0
wg.Wait() unblocks	✅ Done

If the counter never reaches 0, wg.Wait() will block forever.


The difference between calling wg.Add(1) and wg.Add(2) lies in how many goroutines the program expects to wait for before continuing execution. Let’s break down each scenario:
1. wg.Add(1)

When you call wg.Add(1), you are telling the WaitGroup that you expect one goroutine to be started. This means you will wait for one goroutine to finish.

    wg.Add(1): You start one goroutine, and the program will wait for it to finish before moving forward.

    You typically call wg.Add(1) when you are starting one goroutine.

var wg sync.WaitGroup

wg.Add(1)  // Expect one goroutine
go func() {
    defer wg.Done() // Decrement the counter
    fmt.Println("This is a single goroutine.")
}()

wg.Wait()  // Wait for the goroutine to complete
fmt.Println("All goroutines done.")

In this case, the program will create one goroutine, and after that, the main function will wait for this single goroutine to finish before proceeding.
2. wg.Add(2)

When you call wg.Add(2), you are telling the WaitGroup that you expect two goroutines to be started. This means the program will wait for both goroutines to finish before continuing.

    wg.Add(2): You start two goroutines, and the program will wait for both to finish before moving forward.

    You typically call wg.Add(2) when you are starting two goroutines and want to wait for both of them to complete.

var wg sync.WaitGroup

wg.Add(2)  // Expect two goroutines
go func() {
    defer wg.Done() // Decrement the counter
    fmt.Println("This is the first goroutine.")
}()

go func() {
    defer wg.Done() // Decrement the counter
    fmt.Println("This is the second goroutine.")
}()

wg.Wait()  // Wait for both goroutines to complete
fmt.Println("All goroutines done.")

In this case, the program will create two goroutines, and it will wait for both of them to finish before proceeding.
Key Differences Between wg.Add(1) and wg.Add(2):

    Number of Goroutines: wg.Add(1) is for one goroutine, while wg.Add(2) is for two goroutines.

    Waiting Behavior: When you call wg.Wait(), it will block until the number of goroutines you added to the WaitGroup are done. So if you use wg.Add(1), it will wait for one goroutine; with wg.Add(2), it will wait for two goroutines.

How This Affects Goroutines:

    wg.Add(1) means one task (one goroutine), and main will wait for that task to finish.

    wg.Add(2) means two tasks (two goroutines), and main will wait for both tasks to finish.

Example of wg.Add(1) and wg.Add(2):

var wg sync.WaitGroup

// Using wg.Add(1)
wg.Add(1)  // Expecting one goroutine
go func() {
    defer wg.Done()
    fmt.Println("Single goroutine task.")
}()
wg.Wait()  // Will wait for the above goroutine to finish

// Using wg.Add(2)
wg.Add(2)  // Expecting two goroutines
go func() {
    defer wg.Done()
    fmt.Println("First goroutine task.")
}()
go func() {
    defer wg.Done()
    fmt.Println("Second goroutine task.")
}()
wg.Wait()  // Will wait for both goroutines to finish

Conclusion:

    wg.Add(1): You start and wait for one goroutine.

    wg.Add(2): You start and wait for two goroutines.

If you are only starting one goroutine, use wg.Add(1). If you're starting multiple goroutines, use wg.Add(n) where n is the number of goroutines you're launching. The main function will then wait for exactly n goroutines to finish before continuing.
You said:
the diff is the number of go and done you call wg.Add(1) and wg.Add(2) but what its means that when if you use wg.Add(1) and the program loops 10 times the wg.Add(1) add more go routine to execute them 
ChatGPT said:

Yes, you're correct! The key point here is that when you call wg.Add(1) inside a loop, you're effectively telling the WaitGroup that you are going to start one goroutine for each iteration of the loop. So, even though you're calling wg.Add(1) only once per loop, it will increment the number of goroutines tracked by the WaitGroup as the loop runs.
Here's a breakdown:

    Calling wg.Add(1) Inside a Loop:

        In the loop, every time you call go func() {...}, a new goroutine is started.

        The wg.Add(1) call increments the WaitGroup counter to track that one new goroutine.

        Each goroutine will execute concurrently, but the program will wait for all of them to finish by calling wg.Wait() at the end of the program.

    What Happens Inside the Loop:

        If the loop runs 10 times, each iteration will call wg.Add(1) to increase the counter by 1.

        Then, the loop will start 10 goroutines (one for each iteration), each executing the function concurrently.

        After all goroutines are launched, wg.Wait() will block until all 10 goroutines finish.

Example:

var wg sync.WaitGroup

// Loop to start multiple goroutines
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)  // Increment the WaitGroup counter for each goroutine
    go func(i int) {
        defer wg.Done()  // Decrement the counter when the goroutine finishes
        fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d is running\n", i)
    }(i)
}

// Wait for all goroutines to finish
wg.Wait()
fmt.Println("All goroutines done.")

How it works:

    In this example, the loop runs 10 times, and each time the loop runs, wg.Add(1) is called, meaning that the WaitGroup counter is incremented by 1.

    Each time the loop runs, a new goroutine is started via go func(i int) {...}.

    After starting all 10 goroutines, the program will call wg.Wait(), which will block until all 10 goroutines have finished executing.

    The defer wg.Done() ensures that once a goroutine finishes, it decrements the WaitGroup counter.

Important Points:

    wg.Add(1) increments the counter by 1 each time it's called, and one new goroutine is launched for each call inside the loop.

    The wg.Wait() function will block until the counter reaches zero, i.e., until all goroutines have finished executing.

Parallelism vs. Concurrency:

    Concurrency: Multiple tasks are being executed at the same time, but not necessarily on different CPU cores. In this case, multiple goroutines (tasks) will run concurrently.

    Parallelism: If the machine has enough CPU cores (say 10 cores), those 10 goroutines might be executed in parallel, with each core executing one goroutine simultaneously.

Why Use wg.Add(1) Inside a Loop?

    You use wg.Add(1) in a loop when you want to start a new goroutine for each iteration and track how many goroutines you're launching. The WaitGroup ensures that the program waits until all goroutines complete their tasks.

So, to summarize: when you use wg.Add(1) inside a loop, you are tracking and waiting for multiple goroutines to finish. Each iteration of the loop starts one goroutine, and wg.Wait() will ensure that all goroutines are completed before the program proceeds.


key difference between calling wg.Add(1) in a loop versus calling wg.Add(10) outside of the loop. Here's how it works:
wg.Add(1) Inside a Loop:

    When you call wg.Add(1) inside the loop, you are incrementing the WaitGroup counter by 1 each time the loop runs.

    Each call to go inside the loop will start one goroutine. So if the loop runs 10 times, it will launch 10 goroutines (one per loop iteration).

    You need to call wg.Done() once for each goroutine to decrement the WaitGroup counter after the goroutine finishes. If you don't call wg.Done() for each goroutine, the WaitGroup will never reach zero, causing the program to hang at wg.Wait().

Example (with wg.Add(1) inside the loop):

var wg sync.WaitGroup

// Loop runs 10 times
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)  // Increment the WaitGroup counter for each goroutine
    go func(i int) {
        defer wg.Done()  // Decrement the counter when the goroutine finishes
        fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d is running\n", i)
    }(i)
}

// Wait for all goroutines to finish
wg.Wait()
fmt.Println("All goroutines done.")

In this case, each time the loop runs, it calls wg.Add(1), and then a new goroutine is started. Once each goroutine finishes, it calls wg.Done(). The program will wait for all 10 goroutines to complete using wg.Wait().
wg.Add(10) Outside of the Loop:

    If you call wg.Add(10) before the loop (not inside it), you are telling the WaitGroup to expect 10 goroutines to finish.

    In this case, you still need to launch 10 goroutines and call wg.Done() once for each goroutine. However, you're not incrementing the counter for each individual goroutine. Instead, you're simply setting the counter to 10 in advance, and the program will wait for all 10 goroutines to complete.

Example (with wg.Add(10) outside of the loop):

var wg sync.WaitGroup

wg.Add(10)  // Expect 10 goroutines

// Loop runs 10 times
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    go func(i int) {
        defer wg.Done()  // Decrement the counter when the goroutine finishes
        fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d is running\n", i)
    }(i)
}

// Wait for all goroutines to finish
wg.Wait()
fmt.Println("All goroutines done.")

In this case, the counter is set to 10 before the loop begins. Each goroutine is started, and once they finish, each will call wg.Done() to decrement the counter. The program will then wait until the counter reaches zero, signaling that all goroutines have finished.
Key Differences:

    With wg.Add(1) inside the loop:

        You increment the counter for each iteration of the loop.

        This ensures that the WaitGroup counter matches the number of goroutines you are launching.

        You have to call wg.Done() for each goroutine individually.

        This is often the preferred approach when the number of goroutines depends on the loop's iteration.

    With wg.Add(10) outside the loop:

        You set the WaitGroup counter to 10 in advance, assuming you are launching exactly 10 goroutines.

        You don't need to increment the counter during the loop, but you still need to call wg.Done() for each goroutine.

        This approach is simpler when you already know how many goroutines you're launching and don't need to dynamically adjust the counter during the loop.

Summary:

    wg.Add(1) inside a loop is useful when you want to start one goroutine per loop iteration and track the number of goroutines dynamically.

    wg.Add(10) outside the loop is useful when you know exactly how many goroutines you will be launching and want to set the counter upfront.
