building the Go code first (compiling it) and then running the binary is generally faster than running it using go run, especially in terms of startup time.

Here’s why:
✅ What happens with go run:

    It compiles the code to a temporary binary behind the scenes.

    Then it immediately runs that temporary binary.

    This adds a small delay every time you run the program.

✅ What happens with go build:

    It compiles your code once to a native binary (.exe on Windows, no extension on Linux/macOS).

    You can then run this binary as many times as you like with zero compilation time.

⏱️ Performance difference:

    Startup time: go build binary is faster because there’s no compile step.

    Execution time: Both are the same once the code is running, because both run the same compiled code.

    Biggest gain: For repeated executions (like cron jobs, scheduled tasks, or automation scripts), go build is always better.

👇 Example:
```sh
go build -o ec2manager main.go
./ec2manager
```

You only need to rebuild if you change the code.
