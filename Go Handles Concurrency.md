When we talk about concurrency in Go, we mean that the program is managing multiple tasks that seem to be happening at the same time. However, they may not all run simultaneously, and in fact, Go typically runs them sequentially, switching between tasks very quickly.
How Go Handles Concurrency:

Go uses goroutines for concurrency. When you launch a goroutine, you're not telling the program to start executing in parallel at that moment. Instead, you're telling the Go runtime, “Hey, when you're ready, execute this task in the background.”

Here’s how Go deals with concurrency:

    Scheduling:

        When you call go func() { ... }, you are starting a goroutine.

        The Go scheduler decides when to actually run that goroutine.

        Goroutines do not run at the same time unless your machine has multiple CPU cores and the Go scheduler assigns them to different cores.

    Context Switching:

        Go uses a single-threaded event loop to manage multiple goroutines, which is known as the Go runtime scheduler.

        If there are multiple goroutines, the scheduler will switch between them very quickly. This happens so fast that it appears as though all goroutines are running at once.

        The switching between goroutines is known as a context switch. This is not the same as parallelism, but it gives the appearance of multiple tasks being processed at the same time.

    Concurrency — Not necessarily simultaneous:

        Concurrency means that you’re dealing with multiple tasks at once (tasks are being worked on), but they might not all be running simultaneously.

        In Go, the tasks (goroutines) are interleaved, meaning the Go runtime switches between them quickly.

        If you're working on an I/O-bound task (like waiting for a web request or reading from a file), the Go scheduler can switch to another task while waiting, which keeps things progressing concurrently.

    Example of Concurrency (Without Parallelism):

    go func() { fmt.Println("Task 1") }
    go func() { fmt.Println("Task 2") }
    go func() { fmt.Println("Task 3") }
    go func() { fmt.Println("Task 4") }

    Even on a single-core machine, all 4 of these tasks will appear to execute at the same time. The Go runtime will switch between them, giving each one a small amount of time to execute, and they'll finish in no particular order, but the system will make progress on each task without necessarily running them in parallel.

    How the Scheduler Decides When to Switch:

        Goroutines can be paused (for example, when they are waiting for something like I/O or time).

        When a goroutine is paused, the Go scheduler can pick another goroutine to run.

        Go channels are one common way to coordinate between goroutines. A goroutine may send or receive messages through channels, and when one is blocked, it will yield, giving the scheduler a chance to run another goroutine.

Example of Task Switching (Concurrency):

Let’s assume you have a simple example like this:

func task1() {
    fmt.Println("Starting Task 1")
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Simulate work
    fmt.Println("Finished Task 1")
}

func task2() {
    fmt.Println("Starting Task 2")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Simulate work
    fmt.Println("Finished Task 2")
}

func main() {
    go task1()
    go task2()

    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // Wait for tasks to finish
}

How it works:

    The Go scheduler runs task1() and task2() concurrently. Both goroutines are now in the "running" state.

    task1 sleeps for 2 seconds, and task2 sleeps for 1 second.

    The Go runtime will likely switch between these two tasks:

        It starts task1, then moves to task2 while task1 is sleeping.

        After task2 finishes, it will switch back to task1 to complete it.

    Even though the tasks are not executed at the exact same time (they are on one CPU core), they are concurrently being worked on.

Why Does This Appear Parallel?

On a single-core system, these tasks won’t be executed at exactly the same time. However, the Go scheduler can switch between them so quickly that it appears like they are running in parallel.

On a multi-core system, tasks can actually run in parallel, where one goroutine might run on core 1 and another on core 2. This can happen if the Go runtime detects that there are available cores to assign these goroutines.
Key Takeaways:

    Concurrency: Multiple tasks progress independently. They might not run at the same time but are managed in a way that allows them to make progress without blocking the others.

    Parallelism: Multiple tasks running at the same time on multiple CPU cores.

    The Go runtime scheduler switches between tasks rapidly (for concurrency) or assigns them to multiple cores (for parallelism).

You said:

ChatGPT said:

Yes, the switching between goroutines does pause the current goroutine when the Go scheduler decides to switch to another one.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how this works:
1. Pausing the Current Goroutine

    When a goroutine is running, it occupies the CPU. The Go scheduler might pause it for several reasons, such as:

        The goroutine has yielded (perhaps waiting for I/O or sleeping).

        It has completed its work and needs to switch.

        It’s waiting on a channel operation (e.g., chan <- or <- chan).

    When the scheduler decides it’s time to switch to another goroutine, it pauses the current one and saves its state (such as its execution stack). The paused goroutine will be resumed later, either when it can continue or when a condition is met (e.g., I/O is ready).

2. The Switch (Context Switching)

    Context switching happens when the Go scheduler moves from one goroutine to another. This means the Go runtime is deciding to let another goroutine do work, and pauses the current one temporarily.

    The amount of time the scheduler gives each goroutine to run is typically very short (often referred to as a time slice).

    During the switch, the current goroutine is paused until it’s scheduled again. This pause can happen for various reasons:

        Blocking operations: If the goroutine is waiting for a result (e.g., data from a channel or a network request), it’s paused until the result is ready.

        Sleep: If a goroutine is sleeping (time.Sleep()), it’s paused until the specified sleep duration is over.

        I/O operations: If a goroutine is blocked on an I/O operation, it pauses until the I/O operation completes.

3. Concurrency vs Parallelism

    In a single-core machine, Go will switch between goroutines even though only one goroutine can run at a time. This gives the appearance of concurrency but it’s really just the Go scheduler switching back and forth between tasks.

    On a multi-core machine, Go can actually execute multiple goroutines in parallel if there are multiple available cores. The Go runtime can assign different goroutines to different cores to run them in parallel, but even then, context switching can still happen on each core if the scheduler needs to switch between goroutines.

4. How Switching Affects Goroutines

    When a goroutine is paused (during a context switch), it cannot make progress until it is resumed. This is similar to how threads in traditional programming might be paused and resumed, but the Go scheduler is more lightweight and optimized for high concurrency.

    For example, if a goroutine is waiting on a channel operation (e.g., <-chan), it is paused, and another goroutine is scheduled to run instead. When data becomes available on the channel, the paused goroutine can resume and continue from where it left off.

5. Can Goroutines Block Each Other?

    Yes, goroutines can block each other depending on the situation. For instance:

        If multiple goroutines are trying to access a shared resource (e.g., a variable or a file) and there’s no synchronization mechanism (like a mutex), one goroutine could block while waiting for another to finish.

        If a goroutine is waiting on a channel operation and no other goroutine is sending data to that channel, it will block and pause, waiting for data to come through.

Example of Pausing and Switching:

func task1() {
    fmt.Println("Task 1 starting")
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)  // Pauses task1
    fmt.Println("Task 1 finished")
}

func task2() {
    fmt.Println("Task 2 starting")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)  // Pauses task2
    fmt.Println("Task 2 finished")
}

func main() {
    go task1()
    go task2()
    
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // Allow time for tasks to finish
}

How it works:

    task1() starts, and then it sleeps for 2 seconds.

    The Go scheduler switches to task2(), which sleeps for 1 second.

    The scheduler continues to switch between these tasks based on their sleep times, pausing one when the other is executing.

    After both sleep durations complete, the tasks resume and finish.

Key Points:

    Context switching involves pausing a goroutine and allowing another to run.

    The Go scheduler decides when to switch based on factors like sleeping, blocking, or yielding.

    Concurrency makes it look like all tasks are being done at once, even though they may not be running at exactly the same time.

    Parallelism is a different concept, where tasks can run on different CPU cores at the same time.

So, in short, yes, goroutines are paused when the Go scheduler switches between them, and that’s how multiple tasks can be handled concurrently, even on a single CPU core.
