 Summary of the Workflow:

    Filtering with Tags:
    You can filter EC2 instances based on tags (e.g., Name, instance_mode, or any other tag) without knowing the instance IDs beforehand. This allows you to dynamically discover which instances match your criteria.

    Fetching Instance Information:
    Once youâ€™ve filtered instances by tags, AWS will return a list of instances that match the tags you've specified. This list will include the instance IDs as part of the response, along with other metadata like instance type, state, etc.

    Applying Changes:
    To actually apply changes (e.g., upgrade, revert instance type, stop, start, etc.), you still need to use the instance IDs because they are the unique identifiers for each EC2 instance. The instance ID is required to target the specific instance when performing actions like stopping, modifying, or tagging.

ðŸŽ¯ Example Flow:

    Filter instances based on tags:

descOutput, err := ec2Client.DescribeInstances(ctx, &ec2.DescribeInstancesInput{
    Filters: []ec2types.Filter{
        {
            Name:   aws.String("tag:instance_mode"),  // Filter by instance_mode tag
            Values: []string{"other_instances"},
        },
    },
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to describe instances: %v", err)
}

Loop through the filtered instances (access instance ID from the response):

    for _, reservation := range descOutput.Reservations {
        for _, instance := range reservation.Instances {
            id := *instance.InstanceId   // Get the instance ID
            currentType := string(instance.InstanceType)  // Get the current instance type

            fmt.Printf("Found instance %s with type %s\n", id, currentType)

            // Now, you can apply changes to the instance using the ID
            stopAndModify(ctx, ec2Client, id, "t3.medium", false)
        }
    }

    Apply changes to each instance:

        You can now perform actions like stopping, modifying attributes, or starting instances, using the id you retrieved from the filtered instances.

ðŸ§  Why Use the Instance ID:

    Uniqueness: The instance ID is the unique identifier for each EC2 instance. It's required by AWS APIs to apply any changes.

    Targeting Specific Instances: When you want to stop or modify a specific instance, AWS needs to know which one. The ID ensures you target the correct instance.

So, while tags help you find and filter instances, the instance ID is still needed when you want to actually perform actions on the instances you've found.
